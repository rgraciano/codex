# codex

This is a prototype client with enforced rules for Codex.

In this v0.1, we will be able to play a turn, generate forum output, and a link for the
other player to play their turn with current game state.  Multiple branches of a game
could be created by using the same link repeatedly (feature, not bug).  

The React-TS client is in a separate repo. It's very dumb / basic by design. The game server tells it everything and the client just renders.
