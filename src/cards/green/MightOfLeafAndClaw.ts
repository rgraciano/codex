// OnDealCombatDamage, MOLAC gives itself a rune.

// Implement giveBonus and removeBonus.  When OnDealCombatDamage sees that MOLAC is about to get its 5th rune, call giveBonus for all of our units.

// giveBonus checks if 5 runes; if not, return (do nothing).  If 5 runes, go through all of our units giving them +5/+5.

// removeBonus checks if 5 runes; if not, return (do nothing).  If 5 runes, go through all of our units and remove +5/+5.
